Xenophobia has become synonymous to South Africa.</p>\n<p>But things are gradually changing as other Africans become better known with time and as other African countries join the success list, politically and economically.</p>\n<p>South Africa, well steeped in racial history had always sought to identify with the first world, while the first world itself have re-discovered Africa&#8217;s massive potential. That outlook has seen the Zuma administration join the economic grouping Brics and the G20 to the neglect of a strong African economic union.</p>\n<p>Black South Africa woke up belatedly to discover that the flights from Johannesburg flying North to the rest of africa was filled with white South africans freed from the shackles of apartheid , busy taking adavantage of massive opportunities that had opened up in a growing Africa.</p>\n<p>MTN South Africa, has made a fortune in Nigeria. Its shareholders are largely white.There are more than eighty South African companies registered in Ghana.</p>\n<p>The South African investors are prevalent in the following sectors: mining, retail, insurance, transport, tourism, banking, telecommunication, construction, services, franchising, manufacturing, fishing, advertising, aviation and energy. A rapidly growing economy has seen Ghana register the highest growth rate in the world last year at 14.2&#160;%. The nascent oil industry with Ghana joining the exporters club , has attracted interest globally and the South African government has seen the need to nurture an african brotherhood narrative or risk losing out big time.</p>\n<p>Petro SA signed some lucrative agreements. In recent years, trade between South Africa and Ghana has grown significantly. South African exports have grown from less than R1 billion in 1998 to over R3 billion in 2009.</p>\n<p>Equally, imports from Ghana have shown constant increase during the same period. Products such as vehicles, machinery, mechanical appliances; electrical equipment, base metals, aircraft, vessels &amp; associated products contributes to the increased exports to Ghana. The gradual realisation is that Africans should have the confidence to invest in themselves and to invest in one another, or continue to be marginalized in the global scheme of things.</p>\n<p>Last year Nigerians invested 1.6 billion USD in the Ghanaian economy. So who needs to go cap in hand looking for money in a collapsing Europe and a bankrupt America.</p>\n<p>Right thinking South African companies have been quick off the mark and are now reaping the rewards as well as helping improve other African countries with their superior business systems and technology.</p>",
